            <p class="about-text">Welcome to the Poké-Pet, where "Understood the assignment" meets "main character energy"! This isn’t just a Pokédex—it’s your personal tik tok rizz party to pick a Pokémon, feed it, train it, and evolve it into an absolute slay. Forget mid; this site is "bussin’, no cap". Feeling lazy? Go full "sicko mode" with your Pokémon. Hungry Pikachu? Sheesh, toss it a Lunchly and Prime bottle. Charmander won’t listen? That's okay, he's "Built different." Here, we’re all about "vibes", leaving no crumbs, and the talk tuah podcast. Do it for the plot, We're in our "Pokémon rizzler era." Let’s get to work! </p>

                <p class="about-text">I'm a chill guy who loves programming, especially in Python but I will program in other languages if I need to, because I LOVE LEARNING new things. I find joy in solving problems and building things that can make a difference. My passion for coding goes beyond just writing lines of code—it's about using my skills to help others and create positive change in the future.
